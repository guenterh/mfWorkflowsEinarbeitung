# Enriched (Alternative) Line

The enriched line workflow consists of two parts:
1. A [transformation step](./ntriplesEncoding/transformation.flux) from MARC21 to N-Triples, a RDf serialization.
2. A [transformation step](./ntriplesDecoding/transformation.flux) from N-Triples into a special JSON-LD format which is compatible to the specifications of the
[Bulk API of Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html). This step
results in a single Elasticsearch type. An other FLUX file ([decode-ntriples.flux](./ntriplesDecoding/obolete/transformation.flux)) is provided
but it does only work with a VIAF enrichment and is thus obsolete.

This workflow allows to enrich datasets with data e.g. from VIAF or DBPedia using dedicated tools (e.g. [LIMES](http://aksw.org/Projects/LIMES.html))
in an intermediary step. The first part of the workflow expects a MARC21 dataset as input, the second part an enriched
N-Triples file.
